# UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!!!

Another custom mode save game file for players who want to skip most of the main missions and get straight to exploring, building or starting the new **Autophage Questline**. If you are wanting to complete The Purge yourself so you can pick your own galaxy type, see [this page](https://github.com/limbosworld/NMS-The-Purge). 

## Description

Whether you are new to the game, a long-time player or a chronic restarter (like me), this will help you each time you want to start a new game. When you load this save, you will be on a Paradise planet with a small portal base. The Purge will have been completed and you will notice (when you activate your Base Teleportor) a second portal base in Eissentam and a settlement on the same planet. Now you can jump back and forth between Euclid and Eissentam and use the portals to explore each galaxy.

#### This quick start save is also great to use for testing and tinkering without having to listen to Artemis, Apollo or -null- pinging you in the background. Hack away at the save file and if something goes wrong, just re-paste this JSON and start over.

* Starbirth [Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Starbirth)
* The Settlers [All Buildings Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Planetary_Settlement) ,but this mission never ends. There will always be a dispute or a decision pending. Nothing bad happens if you just ignor it. Visit the Pub and watch the Korvax dance in front of the beatbox machine.
* A Trace of Metal [Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/A_Trace_of_Metal)
* Under A Rebel Star [Not Completed](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Under_a_Rebel_Star?so=search) was not started because I didn't want to have a new save file that was too big or displayed too much in game play-time. Currently the play-time is about 6.5 hours. Additionally, there are other missions and quests that were not done. I don't do multiplayer and no expeditions were ever undertaken.

### Steps

1.  Back up your save folder
2.  Start a new custom save
3.  As soon as it loads, get in ond out of your ship or give the game long enough to make an auto-save
4.  Quit the game
5.  Open NMSSaveEditor and open the newly created save - Make sure you are on the right one
6.  Click Edit Raw JSON
7.  Select all code and delete it
8.  Open the JSON file you downloaded with a suitable editor like Sublime Text or Notepad++ 
9.  Copy and paste all code into the Raw JSON editor.
10. Close the raw JSON window and save. Also, click save changes before closing the save editor.

#### When you start your new save, the only thing that should be in your mission log is: The Settlers and Base Computer Archives

### Note:
* This new save file was created with a fresh install of NMS 4.45 and with the help of NMSSaveEditor 1.14.4

* Don't forget to change your game mode or difficulty settings to what you like... then get a better multi-tool, ship and freighter.

### Eissentam portal base and Settlement:
This overgrown planet is beautiful, but it does have super heated rainstorms. They don't last long though and are not too frequent.
